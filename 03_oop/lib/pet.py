#Todo 1: Create a dog class, first use pass, and create an instance of the class
#Then use the __init__ to set attributes, and create an instance of the class

    #Global Variables

    #__init__ will set the state when the class is created

        #append the species to the list, if the species is not in the list
       
    #Instance Methods
    #create a method to print the name
   

    #create a method that will add to the number of cupcakes, only if the type is int and cupcakes is greater than 0
    #if cupcakes is less than 0, raise an error
    #if cupcakes is not a number, raise an error
 
    #Properties
    #create a property that will get and set the name
   
    #To avoid calling get_name and set_name everytime we could use the python decorator property():https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/property 
    #This will set some code to a attribute of your class


    #Class Methods
    #create a class method that will print all the dogs
   
    #create a class method that will add a new species to the list
 

    #__repr__ will run when you print on the class

#Todo 2: Instantiate a few dogs

#append a name to the list and print

#Todo 3: Creating a Global Variables
#create a new array of medicine and append a medicine to the list, print the results

#Todo 4: Create a method and print result

#Todo 5: Output of the __repr__

#Todo 6: use the property() method, to set and get 

#Todo 7: Decorators and CLS (@classmethod)
